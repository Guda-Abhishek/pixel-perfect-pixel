- [ ] Apply design-reference guidance and verify local asset/icon licenses.
- [ ] Validate routes, factual rules, interactions and mobile layout.

- [x] Add four selectable profiles, optional intro, and profile switching.
- [x] Apply cinematic red/charcoal design, billboard and accessible details.
- [x] Add horizontal project/episode rows, skill categories, and awards.
- [x] Connect supplied social URLs and honest bio/resume/contact actions.
- [x] Test factual rules, desktop/mobile interactions, accessibility and errors.

# Optional AI portfolio introduction

# Delivery plan and release gates (2026-10-31)

Status: the roadmap below is the execution order. A checkbox is not considered complete until there is evidence from a successful build/test run or documented manual acceptance. Do not merge to main or publish/deploy without explicit approval.

## P0 — unblock engineering and establish reliable validation

1. **EPIC-01 — Build stability and engineering foundation**
   - [x] Align the package manifest with the existing lockfile: `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` is now `2.25.3` in both files (commit `4fd8402`).
   - [ ] If the intended dependency target is still `2.26.5`, regenerate the lockfile with Node.js 24/npm in a network-enabled environment; do not hand-edit lockfile integrity/resolution metadata.
   - [ ] Run and record `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` successfully. These have not yet been run against the aligned commit.
   - [x] Verification workflow configuration is limited to pushes to `dev`, pull requests targeting `dev`/`main`, or manual dispatch, with cancellation of stale runs; a successful run is still needed.
2. **EPIC-02 — Portfolio-wide functional validation**
   - [ ] Build a route/interaction acceptance matrix for all four profiles and record browser-level results.
   - [ ] Cover desktop, tablet and mobile, including loading, empty, offline, validation and failure states.
   - [ ] Verify navigation, chat/voice, contact, resume workflows and profile-data isolation.
   - [x] Add data-level acceptance tests for project/slug consistency, navigation data, contact destinations, experience, skills and certifications (commit `c7c407c`); run them and add browser smoke checks based on the matrix.

## Development-only execution (user direction, 2026-10-31)

Testing and validation work is paused by user request. Continue feature implementation on the current feature branch; do not run tests, build, lint, browser checks, or acceptance exercises until the user resumes that work.

## P1 — product capabilities

3. **EPIC-07 — Resume Manager and document processing**
   - [x] Add client-side search across filename, display name, headline, summary and skills.
   - [x] Add status filtering (all, pending review, approved/published), clear-filters action, result count and published/pending summary counts (commit `f1ed72e`).
   - [x] Save reviewed metadata as a private pending draft without publishing; moving an approved record back to draft removes it from the public approved-resume feed.
   - [ ] Implement document parsing/extraction with a safe manual-review/edit step before any public approval.
   - [x] Add explicit profile assignment (Abhishek, Amulya, Anjini Kumar or Sai); publishing rejects missing/invalid assignment and excludes unassigned or legacy records from the public feed.
   - [x] Render approved resume metadata only on its matching public profile homepage, with no source-file links and no changes to the existing hardcoded portfolio facts (commit `5373a93`).
   - [ ] Authentication/session, storage, upload/download/delete and file-boundary validation are deferred while testing is paused.
4. **EPIC-08 — Dynamic profile updates and publishing**
   - [x] Add a public metadata-only resume highlights section filtered by profile ID; private resume files remain inaccessible from public profile pages (commit `5373a93`).
   - [x] Add an in-manager public-field preview, explicit unpublish/rollback to private pending status, and require profile assignment before publishing (commits `34c10a1`, `9298ca8`, `77b4f54`).
   - [x] Add a final publish confirmation and client-side checks for profile assignment, display name, headline, summary and empty skill entries (commit `4fad5ea`).
   - [ ] Verify preview, approval, publish, rollback and local/hosted behavior when validation resumes.
5. **EPIC-06 — AI assistant, chat and voice**
   - [ ] Verify API configuration, grounded profile-specific answers, streaming/cancellation and honest offline fallback.
   - [ ] Test microphone permissions, unsupported browsers, privacy disclosures and failure recovery.
6. **EPIC-05 — Four profile experiences and content architecture**
   - [ ] Verify typed profile data, shared page components, route compatibility and strict separation of facts across Abhishek, Amulya, Anjini and Sai.
7. **EPIC-04 — Cinematic design and media**
   - [ ] Verify all supplied media assets exist and are correctly licensed/attributed where required.
   - [ ] Complete video intro playback, pause/replay, cleanup, reduced-motion behavior and mobile fallback.
8. **EPIC-03 — Shared UI, navigation and responsive experience**
   - [ ] Validate shared navigation/footer, active states, keyboard operation, responsive layouts and all route links.
9. **EPIC-09 — Security, accessibility and performance**
   - [ ] Audit access control, upload validation, public/private data boundaries, keyboard/screen-reader behavior and performance.
10. **EPIC-10 — End-to-end acceptance and release**
    - [ ] Run the full acceptance matrix on the candidate branch and record results.
    - [ ] Review the complete branch diff and outstanding issues.
    - [ ] Obtain explicit user approval before any merge to `main` or deployment.

## Working rules
- During the user-requested development-only phase, continue feature implementation and explicitly leave validation tasks pending.
- Do not mark validation complete based only on source inspection; record the command/test or manual evidence when testing resumes.
- Do not commit generated lockfile metadata by hand.
- Do not merge to `main`, publish, or deploy without explicit approval.
