## Architecture

- Use `/` for multi-page Home, `/profiles` for the preserved optional profile picker, and retain `/portfolio` as the legacy scrolling experience; shared navigation belongs around new content routes in the root shell.
- Use reusable Button controls and global semantic visual tokens; this keeps focus, interaction, and theming consistent.
- Keep social URLs and the resume asset path nullable in shared configuration; missing verified resources must never produce broken links.
- Validate contact drafts with the shared Zod schema and prepare mailto messages only; no delivery claim is possible without a connected service.
- Use a code monogram instead of a portrait until a real image is supplied; generated portraits cannot represent the owner's likeness.

- Validate viewer selection in route search parameters and derive section/project order from shared rules; URL-based selection survives refresh without storing personal data.
- Reuse Radix dialogs, tabs and menus for portfolio details and switching; these preserve keyboard interaction and focus management.
- Keep the contact form in its reusable component and career facts in shared data; presentation changes must not alter validated draft behavior.
- Keep the optional AI introduction in one shared dialog with a mount-scoped playback hook; opening stays silent and closing cancels only its own speech and timers.
- Keep real and AI-host portrait references separately nullable until the exact uploaded assets are available; never substitute generated faces or conflate identities.
- Serve uploaded intro clips through asset pointers and tie muted video playback to the shared narration state; this keeps Play, Pause and close consistent without autoplay.
- Portfolio chatbot answers only from shared portfolio data via a server endpoint; keeps the AI key server-side and facts consistent.
- New content pages reuse shared factual data, stable project slugs, common page metadata and presentation primitives; edits stay consistent across legacy and multi-page views.
- Person portfolios use typed, isolated resume data and a shared shell under `/people/$person`; `/profiles` selects people and Abhishek redirects to the preserved root site. This prevents facts, navigation, and Abhishek-specific chat from crossing person boundaries.
- Bundle Lucide icons and serve selected unDraw illustrations through asset pointers; this avoids runtime icon API dependence and keeps media out of source bundles.
